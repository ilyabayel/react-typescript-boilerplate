# React+Typescript Boilerplate

## About

This is my version of React+Typescript Boilerplate including Redux, Webpack, Eslint, Prettier, Babel, 
Jest, Enzyme and JSDoc. Feel free to contact me if you want to suggest improvements to this template, 
because it is far from being perfect. <br/>

## Getting Started

First thing first, you need to clone my project from my 
GitHub repo: <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/ilyakozlovdev/react-typescript-boilerplate.git` <br/>
Then install dependencies with yarn `yarn install` or npm `npm install`.<br/>
Finally, run it `yarn dev` || `npm run dev` and start developing something really cool!
